Ludum Dare #44: Aeternum
===

The [Ludum Dare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludum_Dare) is a famous game jam. The goal of the Compo mode is to create a game alone, from scratch, in 48 hours, on a given theme.

The theme for this edition was: *your life is currency*

I made all the graphics, the programming and the dialogues alone. It was my first project with Unity, so I discovered the engine as I was creating the game.
Unfortunately, I couldn't finish the game.

## How to run the game

Download the latest release for your OS (releases for Linux and Windows are available).

On Windows, run `Aeternum.exe`. On Linux, run `aeternum.x86_64`.

## Controls

The game is playable with a gamepad or a keyboard. The keys can be remapped at launch. The defaults are:

* gamepad left joystick/arrows/wasd: move, select dialogue options
* gamepad A/space/enter: next/choose dialogue option
